# OpenAgentsBox - AI Interview Agent

> **"Commercial AI interview coaching is too expensive, so I built my own."**

## Philosophy
Existing interview agents are often overpriced. **OpenAgentsBox** is an open-source alternative.
By bringing your own API Key, you get professional-grade coaching while maintaining full control over your costs.

## Key Features
* **Bring Your Own Key (BYOK)**: Use your own API Key (OpenAI).
* **Privacy First**: Your Key is stored **only in the frontend**. It is never saved on our backend server.
* **Full Functionality**: Resume parsing, job description matching, and mock interview sessions are fully implemented.



## ⚠️ Current Status
* **Prompt Management**: Prompts are currently managed via **LangSmith**.
* **Local Execution**: Full local execution is not yet supported due to cloud dependencies.
* **Live Demo**: Please try the application here: [https://openagentsbox.com/interview](https://openagentsbox.com/interview)


## 🔮 Future Plans
I will continue to develop and share more useful AI agents on my website.
